  This customization file alters Storybook's native classes.
  Before altering/adding custom styles, check if Storybook supports the required need (@storybook/theming),
  and edit the custom theme object (`theme: customTheme,`) used in ./manager.js (for Storybook UI in general / top-bar, side-bar)
  and ./preview.js (for Storybook docs and canvas / main content).
